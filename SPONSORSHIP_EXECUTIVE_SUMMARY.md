# OHCS E-Library: Executive Summary

## AI-Powered Knowledge Platform for Ghana's Civil Service

---

### THE OPPORTUNITY

Ghana's 500,000+ civil servants across 50+ Ministries, Departments, and Agencies (MDAs) lack a unified digital platform for knowledge management, professional development, and collaboration. Critical documents are siloed, institutional knowledge is lost with retiring officers, and there is no structured support for employee wellness.

**The OHCS E-Library is the solution** — a fully-developed, production-ready platform that transforms how Ghana's civil service operates.
